      <h1>Zack Moyal</h1>
      <p>I am a TrueCoders student living in California. I'm 29 years old. I transferred over from CSUCI when I learned about the opportunity and success stories of completing <br>
        a coding bootcamp. I've had a love for computers and how they work since I was in elementary school. I got my first laptop in 7th grade. I work part time and live with <br>
        my amazing girlfriend. I just moved out with her recently, so it's been a challenge trying to juggle work, school, bills, and taking care of her and her elderly mother,<br>
        but so far I'm making steady progress. What I like to do for fun is play video games, have neon blacklight dance parties, ride my e-bike around the city and neighborhoods, <br>
        and hang out with my girlfriend. My family and my girlfriend have helped me achieve my goals throughout my 20's, and I'm very thankful for them. I wouldn't be half the man<br>
        that I am today if it wasn't for their unwavering love and support. Life is full of ups and downs, so I try my best to just breathe and enjoy the moment every single day.<br>
        I consider myself a student of life: always learning from every opportunity presented. I'll leave you with this one quote that I think about often: ‚ÄúEducation is the most<br>
        powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.‚Äù ‚ÄîNelson Mandela<br>

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
      <strong>point</strong>," <span style="color:green">Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
